## Events
- The change in the state of an object is known as an Event
- Events are fired to notify code of "interesting changes" that may affect code execution.
1. Mouse events (click, double click etc.)
2. Keyboard events (keypress, keyup, keydown)
3. Form events (submit etc.)
4. Print event & many more

* First preference always goes to js event handler code NOT to a inline event handler
